# UNIT OF WORK PATTERN
Repository Pattern | Hexagon Architecture

Example project approaches the Unit Of Work design pattern using [Repository_Pattern Example](https://github.com/NelxRev/backend-design-patterns-py/tree/main/repository_pattern), creating a local data persistence (user model list as in memory repository) and a basic menu as an interface. In addition, the hexagonal architecture was applied.
